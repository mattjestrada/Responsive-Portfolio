# Responsive-Portfolio

So from our first homework assignment I chose the layout assignment and thus copied the skeleton of the layout as told to do so in the instructions. From there I put my own touches to it. For my @media queries I entered them in order from the demands and afterwards was able to type in what I wanted to happen once it reached the max width. I also used Google which constantly led me to w3 schools to find the more popular functions as to what should happen to your content once it reaches the particular max width.
